# CS210-Airgead-Banking

    The project is used for users to take their investments over a set time and have it calculated to display 
    the total amounts you have invested over the months depending on the amount of years you started your investments.
    
    I practically managed to follow the format that was desired to be displayed as well provided easy to read instructions on 
    what to insert to proceed throughout the prompts.
    
    Since I am new with coding the code itself is basic and straight forward. Depending on the systems used within the company
    having some sort of pin or code you enter in order to access your information would be most logical. Also, with increase time
    making the user interface more updated and modern and easier to understand instead of the current 1970s style.
    
    The most challenging part for the code to write was the part of getting the months to display after the investors inputted their information.
    In order to overcome this had to take a few moments at a time to walk away and come back to reevaluate how I wanted the code to function and how
    I wanted it to be displayed. 
    
    Everything from this project will be able to be transferable to other future projects or work ethics for industry standards because I tried to
    use best coding practices while using in line comments so other future "coders" can easily adjust and edit where needed.
